 This repository includes the projects I have done in signals and systems course - Fall 2019

## CA1 - An Introduction to Signal Processing in MATLAB
This assignment was a warm-up practice to learn MATLAB coding basics for signal processing. It includes practices about 1. matrix operations, 2. convolution operation, and 3. discretizing signals with the desired timestep. For more details about exercises in this computer assignment, check out the "CA#1.pdf" file.

## CA2 - Filtering Noisy Audio
For this assignment, audio with a high-frequency noise was provided for us. The noise is combined with music and vocal sounds in the noisy audio. The task was to filter the noise using a linear time-invariant (LTI) system.
After 8 times passing the audio through the filter, the noise was eliminated, but the amplitude of the remaining signal increased so much. So I modified the filter to tackle this problem. The files having "plus" at the end of their name are filtered using the modified filter. The filtered signal using the modified filter is way more clear than the signal generated by the initial filter.
